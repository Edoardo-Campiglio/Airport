# Airport
A script to manage cargo flights across the world using SQLite

# Goal of the project
This project involves creating a script that, given as input a shipment order from location A to B, automatically assigns a flight and updates the database of the airport. 

# The dataset
The given data comprises two tables: One containing information on many airports, such as longitude and latitude, airport name, airport code (iata code) and size, and another with different available planes, with their range, volume and payload. In order to finish the set-up, assign different planes to airports based on size, and create lists for new orders and flights.

# The script
This script proposes a way to organize flights based on shipment orders and update the database.
